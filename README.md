Don't Drive Like My Brother

This is intended to be a hardware and code project.
## Hardware
A USB battery-backup to run the Pi when it's not being powered by the car.

## Code
Using the SenseHat, log My Brother's Driving habits, including acceleration, turns and heading. Maybe even barometric pressure.
